# Samantha-Portfolio

## Description
Samantha-Portfolio was created as our first step into creating our own webpage without any given starter-code. The goal of this challenge was to plan, sketch, and create our very own web portfolio. I took what I learned about Flexbox and other advanceed CSS and HTML elements to make the website interactive.
